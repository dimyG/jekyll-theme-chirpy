**2001 - 2008**   
Mechanical engineering studies, in the polytechnic school of the 
[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle_University_of_Thessaloniki).

**2008 - 2009**  
Military service (compulsory in Greece).

**2009 - 2015**  
CAE engineer in [BETA CAE Systems](https://www.beta-cae.com/) one of the most successful software houses in Greece. 
Some aspects of my role were setting up and implementing a wide range of CAE analyses using the whole CAE software stack, 
automating tasks with python scripts, debugging the software, writing documentation, converting client needs to software requirements, 
authoring technical CAE papers, performing technical presentations to the clients' engineering teams and on international conferences, 
participating in clients' projects and visiting their premises to offer on-site support and training.

**2015 - 2019**  
Following two of my passions, programming and entrepreneurship, I created [zakanda](https://www.zakanda.com/), 
a web service in the sports betting industry, in an attempt that ultimately failed. Despite the unfortunate 
outcome, this experience was unique and irreplaceable, making me wiser in many aspects both 
in technical, entrepreneurial and in personal level.

**2019 - 2020**  
After the previous failure, I initially tried to go for another entrepreneurial endeavor, broadly researching a lot of industries in an attempt 
to identify possible opportunities, always within the software space, without ultimately proceeding. I instead decided to 
invest in personal development, improving my skills in web development and mathematics while also starting my journey to 
the world of artificial intelligence.

**2020 - now**  
Actively searching for a full stack web development role, either working Î¿n a contract basis or, if there is a good match,
