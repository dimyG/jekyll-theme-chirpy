# Neutrality and digital scarcity
We usually hear that bitcoin could be used in a portfolio as a hedge against fiat money inflation, thanks to its limited supply. 
This common argument has merit indeed and is based on one of bitcoin’s most indisputable properties. It’s **digital scarcity**.  

Some people go much further than that, claiming that bitcoin should completely replace fiat money and the central banks. 
I have to say, that currently I don’t agree on this one. I’m not at all convinced that sound money and Austrian economics 
are a better alternative for achieving the promises of our modern era. I agree that our western governments and central 
banks aren’t perfect by no means, but I do believe that they genuinely care about the prosperity of their people. 
They are part of our societies success, and more or less they support the evolution path towards a society 
of abundance, freedom, peace and happiness. 

Despite this, I can’t neglect the possibility of a catastrophic debt crisis that could spiral down to hyperinflation. 
I don’t think the chances for such a collapse are high, but just in case, wouldn't be wise to have some kind of 
insurance against it? I think it is. 

In this post thought, I would like to explain a different kind of hedging that is discussed much less. A hedge against 
authoritarianism or tyranny of any form. Someone might ask, why is this important? 
Well, the reason is that in my opinion liberal environments are better than authoritarian ones, when measured against 
their capacity to fulfill the promises of abundance, freedom, peace, happiness and unlimited potential. Even in the best 
authoritarian regime, a human benevolent dictator can only last for so long, and can’t have much control on what happens 
after him. Apart from that, liberal environments can be more sustainable in the long term by offering decompression 
valves to societies. In order for bitcoin to be that hedge, it must absolutely preserve this mesmerizing property: **Neutrality**.
A property that arises from decentralization. 

In bitcoin’s short history, people have some times proposed the creation of committees or councils to deal with various 
issues that arise along the way. Most of these proposals are made in good faith, in an attempt to overcome the current 
problems or misconceptions. Any such action though could only hurt bitcoin’s properties, those that make it so unique 
and valuable. Doing so, they increase the risk of bitcoin’s failure.

Bitcoin needs no council, no committee, no central point of any kind or form. Bitcoin just needs to be. Neutral, apolitical, 
indifferent to opinions and strategies. 

The reason that neutrality is important even in the west, is simple but very well hidden under a few generations of 
freedoms and prosperity: We must not take the current evolution path for granted. Our democracies are not as solid 
as we like to think. They are still fragile and there are no guarantees for the future. We have to understand this. 
There is a tendency to believe that societies keep moving forward by default. This is nothing but an illusion. 
It just takes a series of unfortunate events and we could very well find ourselves under a very different reality. 
Just remember how easily the Nazis, an extremist movement led by a paranoid individual with extreme hate and anger, 
managed to take the lead in a country like Germany that plays a huge role in global affairs. And this is not the only example. 

Could the modern western democracies be degraded and fall into an authoritarian trap of any form, state or corporation 
driven? It is unlikely but not impossible. This is why we should be prepared even if the chances are small. We need to 
have the means by which we can escape the control of evil central actors, not only in the realm of information exchange 
but most importantly, in the realm of value exchange too. In these fronts, network neutrality is of paramount importance, 
followed by the property of privacy (in which bitcoin doesn’t excel). 

# Counter arguments
The counter arguments are that these same networks will be used by criminals, hostile sanctioned states or 
authoritarian regimes themselves. Yes, they will. Its the price we have to pay. But how high is that price really?  

Let’s examine the criminals case first. There is a fundamental truth about us humans. Under normal circumstances, 
we are naturally good. Almost all of us. How many of us are murderers, rapists, or torturers? A tiny, tiny fraction. 
Yes, there are more people inclined to do major financial crimes but they are still a very small part of the global population. 
The average person just wants to live a peaceful and fulfilling life. I argue thus, that we shouldn’t sacrifice an 
important defence against a potential future enemy for the vast majority of people, for the sake of a small improvement 
in fighting crime. We have and should find more but different means to fight it. 

A neutral network of value like bitcoin, could be used by hostile entities to evade economic sanctions. Indeed it could,
but what portion of sanctions’ success is based on denial of value transfer? I would argue that the most important reason 
that sanctions succeed is that the counterparties do not want to face the consequences of breaking the law and transacting 
with a sanctioned entity. I could be wrong though.

What about authoritarian entities using it? They could, but doing so, they would reinforce something that could undermine their 
authority. They might try to have as much control on it as possible, but they certainly will not want to validate it by 
using it extensively. Maybe as a hedge and only in secret. But does it worth to deny ourselves a hedge, just to deny 
them one too? I don’t think so.

Another point of concern is that bitcoin could speed up the dethroning of the dollar as the global reserve currency, 
something that would reduce the power of western democracies. This though, can only happen if the dollar fails as a 
result of mismanagement. Using bitcoin as a small part of portfolios (since it is just supposed to be a hedge), 
shouldn’t greatly affect the trust on the dollar.
