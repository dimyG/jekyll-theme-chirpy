# Bitcoin in the west
Appreciating the value proposition of bitcoin is much easier if you are a citizen of what we call, failed states. 
Environments where the local currency is constantly devalued, or in which certain population groups are excluded from 
the financial system, or even oppressed and mistreated. In some of these cases, bitcoin could be a possible solution by 
protecting people's savings from annihilation or offering financial inclusion to everyone.   

But what about its usefulness for the people in the west?

Well, we usually hear that bitcoin could be used in an investment portfolio as a hedge against fiat money inflation, thanks to its limited supply. 
This common argument has merit and is based on one of bitcoin’s most indisputable properties. It’s **digital scarcity**. 
Some people though, go much further than that, claiming that bitcoin should completely replace fiat money and the central banks. 
On this one, I don't currently agree. I’m not at all convinced that sound money and austrian economics 
are a better alternative for achieving the promises of our modern era. Promises of abundance, freedom, peace, happiness 
and unlimited potential. I agree that our western governments and central 
banks aren’t perfect by no means, but I do believe that they genuinely care about the prosperity of their people. 
They are part of our societies success, and more or less they support the evolution path towards a more prosperous society. 

On the other hand, I think it's very challenging if not impossible, for a system with a constant monetary base (bitcoin standard) to improve 
the growth rate or deal with crises. When the value of the currency increases to reflect a growing economy, spending and crediting 
mechanisms are greatly affected. People have an incentive not to spend, something that in theory could damage the economic activity. 
Credit would certainly be a challenge too. People should familiarize themselves with the idea that 
[having a smaller slice of the future pie doesn't mean they are getting poorer]({% post_url 2021-04-23-the-pharaoh-and-the-millionaire #comparing-wealth-states %}) 
and that they should lend their money with negative interest.
Furthermore, what happens in cases of major crises like the
covid one, where many people are in desperate need for cash in order to feed their families? Would we have to rely on the 
merciful rich to lend them money? These are serious issues which can't be just ignored. I don't say there are no solutions, 
but that there are major challenges which should be considered.  

Of course all systems have weaknesses, and I can’t neglect the possibility of a catastrophic fiat debt crisis that 
could spiral down to hyperinflation. 
I don’t think the chances for such a collapse are high, but just in case, wouldn't be wise to have some kind of 
insurance against it? I think it is. 

Apart from this, I would like to address a different kind of hedging that is discussed much less. A hedge against 
authoritarianism or tyranny of any form. Someone might ask, why is this important? 
Well, the reason is that in my opinion liberal environments are better than authoritarian ones, when measured against 
their capacity to fulfill the modern promises. Even in the best 
authoritarian regime, a human benevolent dictator can only last for so long, and can’t have much control on what happens 
after him. Apart from that, liberal environments can be more sustainable in the long term by offering decompression 
valves to societies. In order for bitcoin to be such a hedge, it must absolutely preserve this mesmerizing property: **Neutrality**.
A property that arises from decentralization. 

In bitcoin’s short history, people have some times proposed the creation of bitcoin committees or councils to deal with various 
issues that arise along the way. Most of these proposals are made in good faith, in an attempt to overcome the current 
problems or misconceptions. Any such action though could hurt these bitcoin’s properties that make it so unique 
and valuable, increasing the risk of failure.

Bitcoin needs no council, no committee, no central point of any kind or form. Bitcoin just needs to be. Neutral, apolitical, 
indifferent to opinions and strategies. 

The reason that neutrality is important even in the west, is simple but very well hidden under a few generations of 
freedoms and prosperity. We must not take the current evolution path for granted. Our democracies are not as solid 
as we like to think. They are still fragile and there are no guarantees for the future. 
There is a tendency to believe that societies keep moving forward by default. This is nothing but an illusion. 
It just takes a series of unfortunate events, and we could very well find ourselves under a very different reality. 
Just remember how easily the Nazis, an extremist movement led by a paranoid individual with extreme hate and anger, 
managed to take the lead in a country like Germany that plays a huge role in global affairs. And this is not the only example. 

Could the modern western democracies be degraded and fall into an authoritarian trap of any form, state or corporation 
driven? It is unlikely but not impossible. This is why we should be prepared even if the chances are small. We need to 
have the means by which we can escape the control of "evil" central actors, not only in the realm of information exchange 
but most importantly, in the realm of value exchange too. In these fronts, network neutrality is of paramount importance, 
followed by the property of privacy (in which bitcoin doesn’t excel). Bitcoin and any other network which is sufficiently 
neutral, would have a crucial role to play.  

# Counterarguments
The counterarguments are that these same networks will be used by criminals, hostile sanctioned states or 
authoritarian regimes themselves. They could threaten the dominance of western democracies by replacing the dollar as the
global reserve currency, and they consume huge amounts of energy. Some of these arguments are fair. 
There is indeed a price we have to pay. But how high is that price really?

Let’s examine the criminals case first. There is a fundamental truth about us humans. Under "normal" circumstances, 
we are naturally good. Almost all of us. How many of us are murderers, rapists, or torturers? A tiny, tiny fraction. 
Yes, there are more people inclined to do major financial crimes, but they are still a small part of the global population. 
The average person just wants to live a peaceful and fulfilling life. I argue thus, that we shouldn’t sacrifice an 
important defence against a potential future enemy for the vast majority of people, for the sake of a small improvement 
in fighting crime. We have and should find more but different ways to fight it. 

A neutral network of value like bitcoin, could be used by hostile entities to evade economic sanctions. Indeed it could,
but what portion of sanctions’ success is based on denial of value transfer? I would argue that the most important reason 
that sanctions succeed is that the counterparties do not want to face the consequences of breaking the law and transacting 
with a sanctioned entity. I could be wrong though.

What about authoritarian entities using it? They could, but doing so, they would reinforce something that could undermine their 
authority. They might try to have as much control on it as possible, but they certainly will not want to validate it by 
using it extensively. Maybe as a hedge and only in secret. But does it worth to deny ourselves a hedge, just to deny 
them one too? I don’t think so.

Another point of concern is that bitcoin could speed up the dethroning of the dollar as the global reserve currency, 
reducing the power of western democracies. This though, can only happen if the dollar fails as a 
result of mismanagement. Using bitcoin as a small part of portfolios (since it is just supposed to be a hedge), 
shouldn’t greatly affect the trust on the dollar. 

Bitcoin consumes of a lot of energy. Indeed, the neutrality of the bitcoin network is secured by a consensus mechanism 
that is based on a huge number of computing nodes which consume a lot of energy. 
A lot of our modern day activities are energy hungry though. Take televisions for example. They collectively consume a lot of energy, but 
we don't condemn them because of that. We weigh in the benefits with the costs and decide that we want to use them. So the 
real question is if this energy consumption offers us something at least equally valuable. My opinion is clear. 
An insurance policy against a major threat, does worth it. 
Besides, there is a global shift towards renewable sources of energy, and it is a fact that bitcoin is already ahead of 
the curve in terms of renewables adoption. Not only that, but it could even improve the efficiency of renewables 
as the buyer of unused energy that can't be stored.

Through this prism, I believe that western authorities should nurture this new and rapidly evolving space since its 
benefits outweigh the cost.
