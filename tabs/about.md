Welcome dear visitor. My name is Dimitris Georgoulas. I'm a full stack web developer and mechanical engineer.
This is my personal blog which I intent to use both as a showcase of
[my professional experience]({% link categories/experience.html %}) and as
a means by which I can express myself, writing for anything I consider interesting or important.

As one of my passions is understanding the technological background of our world, of which the backbone is software,
I regularly dedicate time to learn new things, usually starting with a broad exploration and then selecting where to go deep.
My method of learning involves a rigorous process of note keeping and as a result I have stacked through the years
a large collection of technical notes, for topics ranging from computer science to web
development to artificial intelligence, blockchain and mathematics, parts of which I plan to publish in this blog on a regular basis.
I have to admit though, that the process of bringing raw notes in a form suitable for publishing is rather a time consuming task...

Going to my background, I studied mechanical engineering in the polytechnic school of the [Aristotle University of
Thessaloniki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle_University_of_Thessaloniki)
from which I graduated at 2008. After finishing the obligatory in Greece military service, I joined [BETA CAE Systems](https://www.beta-cae.com/),
one of the larger software houses in Greece, to which I stayed until 2015, working as a [CAE engineer]({% post_url 2020-06-01-my-experience-as-a-cae-engineer %}).
2015 was the starting point of the next chapter in my professional life, as I switched focus to web development and after a
[failed entrepreneurial endeavor]({% post_url 2020-06-02-my-epic-fail-as-a-sports-betting-entrepreneur %}),
I currently work as a freelance web developer, focused on **django** and **react** ecosystems.

Apart from my involvement in the CAE software industry and the many years of coding experience in python, I have one large
[web project]({% post_url 2020-06-03-zakanda_technical_overview %}) under my belt,
from which I acquired extensive experience in all aspects of web development. While I'm pretty confident about my skills as a full stack web
application developer, I'm less confident about the devops side of things, but I consider myself an eternal student and a competent problem solver
who can tackle any issues that might arise in the course of a project, across the whole stack.

Currently I'm available for hiring at a rate of _40€ per hour_. If you are considering to outsource one of your projects and you feel
that I would be a suitable candidate for the job, feel free to reach me at **dimgeows@gmail.com**. I would be happy to
discuss with you about your goals and the ways I could help you to achieve them.
