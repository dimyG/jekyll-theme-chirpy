Hey there! I'm Dimitris.

I'm a software engineer with a diverse technical background. This is my personal blog which I intend to use both as a showcase of
[my work experience]({% post_url 2020-05-30-work-experience-overview %}) and as
a means by which I can express myself, writing for anything I consider interesting or important.

Since I believe that character and personality are at least as important as the technical skills, I think it would be more appropriate
if I would start from there...

- I love to explore and understand the big picture before digging into the details.
- I love the details too, because they make things work and give me the satisfaction of achievement.
- Putting the pieces together is one of my most enjoyable experiences.
- I know I'm not exceptionally smart so, I try to counterbalance that with methodical approaches and persistence.
- I have built through the years decent mental world models which I continuously enhance.
- I embrace the difficulties of becoming a specialized generalist. I have suffered in this path.
- I understand the importance of simplicity, but sometimes it annoyingly escapes me.
- I'm a restless and risk tolerant soul.
- I'm rarely not passionate with something, and when I'm passionate, I'm hooked.
- Achieving and maintaining a state of high focus and alertness while working, is extremely fulfilling for me. I try to be there for a few hours every day.
- I communicate better asynchronously.
- "Listen with the intent to understand, not the intent to reply". I find this motto particularly important.
- I like to think of myself as a reliable person with integrity.
- I try to be at best shape every day. I don't always succeed.
- I now know the importance of good sleep, healthy diet, exercise and meaningful relations.
- I have spent a lot of time and energy on things that didn't matter. I now understand the difference between being busy and being productive.
- I also understand the importance of doing meaningful work that positively impacts people's lives.
- I constantly evolve and as a consequence, the limits of my potential are becoming more obvious to me.
I'm accepting them, becoming more realistic and humble along the way, trying to employ delegation and leverage.

This list is not exhaustive by any means, but it is genuine nonetheless.

On to the technical stuff...

I have a mechanical engineering degree from a
top tier Greek university, and I started my career as a support engineer in one of the most successful software
development companies in the field of engineering analysis software. It was not purely a developer role,
but I loved programming, and I was learning web development on the side.
A few years later I left the company to create a web application and even though it wasn’t financially successful,
I gained valuable software development experience as I architected, designed, and developed the whole system from scratch.
I dedicated the period that followed to explore the fields of blockchain initially, and deep learning lately.
Currently, I'm full steam ahead on software engineering and web development again. My expertise lies in the python
and javascript ecosystems.

In a nutshell my experience includes 5 years of studies, 5,5 years as a technical support engineer, 4 years as a full stack web developer and founder,
1,5 years freely exploring blockchains, finance and deep learning, while from summer 2022 I'm full steam ahead on software engineering.

- I understand the importance of designing a good distributed architecture from the start, with scalability in mind,
implementing microservices with testing, observability and continuous delivery.
- I have a good understanding of the software development life cycle since I have built things from scratch.
- I understand the importance of good documentation and small commits.
- I understand big O notation and have a fundamental understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- I wish I had become familiar with design patterns much earlier in my life.
- I'm comfortable working with
python, django, django-rest-framework, numpy, pandas, javascript, react, redux, postgresql, redis, linux, docker, git, common aws services.
- I would love to work with
serverless, fastAPI, mongodb, kafka, celery, elasticsearch, kubernetes, terraform, prometheus, grafana, typescript.

Two of my projects in the web development field:
- [zakanda]({% post_url 2020-06-03-zakanda_technical_overview %})
- [algozoom]({% post_url 2020-12-02-animations-with-d3-and-react %})

The best way to contact me is via email or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/DimiGeorgoulas).

Thanks for coming by. Have a nice day!
