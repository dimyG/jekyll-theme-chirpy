Welcome dear visitor. My name is Dimitris Georgoulas. I'm a full stack web developer and mechanical engineer, working as a freelancer.
This is my personal blog which I intent to use both as a showcase of
[my work experience]({% link categories/work-experience.html %}) and as
a means by which I can express myself, writing for anything I consider interesting or important.

As one of my passions is understanding the technological background of our world, of which the backbone is software,
I regularly dedicate time to learn new things, usually starting with a broad exploration and then selecting where to go deep.
My method of learning involves a rigorous process of note keeping and as a result I have stacked through the years
a large collection of technical notes, for topics ranging from computer science to web
development to artificial intelligence and mathematics, blockchain and fintech, parts of which I plan to publish in this blog on a regular basis.
I have to admit though, that the process of bringing raw notes in a form suitable for publishing is rather a time consuming task...

Going to my background, I studied mechanical engineering in the polytechnic school of the [Aristotle University of
Thessaloniki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle_University_of_Thessaloniki)
from which I graduated at 2008. After finishing the obligatory in Greece military service, I joined [BETA CAE Systems](https://www.beta-cae.com/),
one of the larger software houses in Greece, to which I stayed until 2015, working as a [CAE engineer]({% post_url 2020-06-01-my-experience-as-a-cae-engineer %}).
2015 was the starting point of the next chapter in my professional life, as I switched focus to web development and after a
[failed entrepreneurial endeavor]({% post_url 2020-06-02-my-epic-fail-as-a-sports-betting-entrepreneur %}),
I currently work as a freelance web developer, focused on python and javascript and more specifically on **django** and **react** ecosystems.

Apart from my involvement in the CAE software industry and the many years of coding experience in python, I have one large
[web project]({% post_url 2020-06-03-zakanda_technical_overview %}) under my belt,
from which I acquired extensive experience in all aspects of web development. While I'm very confident about my skills,
I'm aware of the fact that web development is a very broad and fast moving field and mastering it, is a years long effort
that requires perseverance and constant improvement. I'm also aware of my weaknesses, for example in the devops side of things,
but I consider myself an eternal student and a competent problem solver who can tackle any issues that might arise in
the course of a project, across the whole stack.

Currently I'm available for hiring at a rate of _45€ per hour_. If you are considering to outsource one of your projects and you feel
that I would be a suitable candidate for the job, feel free to reach me at **dimgeows@gmail.com**. I would be happy to
discuss with you about your goals and the ways I could help you to achieve them.
