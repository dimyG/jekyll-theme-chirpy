Welcome dear visitor. My name is Dimitris Georgoulas. I'm a full stack web developer and mechanical engineer.
This is my personal blog which I intent to use both as a showcase of
[my work experience]({% link categories/work-experience.html %}) and as
a means by which I can express myself, writing for anything I consider interesting or important.

As one of my passions is understanding the technological background of our world, of which the backbone is software,
I regularly dedicate time to learn new things, usually starting with a broad exploration and then selecting where to go deep.
My method of learning involves a rigorous process of note keeping and as a result I have stacked through the years
a large collection of technical notes, for topics ranging from computer science to web
development to artificial intelligence and mathematics, fintech, blockchain and economics, parts of which I plan to publish in this blog on a regular basis.
I have to admit though, that the process of bringing raw notes in a form suitable for publishing is rather a time consuming task...

Going to my background, I studied mechanical engineering in the polytechnic school of the [Aristotle University of
Thessaloniki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle_University_of_Thessaloniki)
from which I graduated at 2008. After finishing the obligatory in Greece military service, I joined [BETA CAE Systems](https://www.beta-cae.com/),
one of the most successful software houses in Greece, to which I stayed until 2015, working as a [CAE engineer]({% post_url 2020-06-01-my-experience-as-a-cae-engineer %}).
2015 was the starting point of the next chapter in my professional life, as I switched focus to web development
focused on python and javascript ecosystems with a preference for django and react. After a
[failed entrepreneurial endeavor]({% post_url 2020-06-02-my-epic-fail-as-a-sports-betting-entrepreneur %}),
I had the opportunity to invest in personal development improving my technical skills and expanding the width of my knowledge.
Within 2016 I dived into the bitcoin and decentralization rabbit hole and I closely watch this space ever since while managing
a small personal investment portfolio.

My goal is to gain the means to continue the mythical journey of
[understanding intelligence]({% post_url 2020-06-04-thinking-about-intelligence %}), building interesting and useful stuff along the way.
