I'm a mechanical and software engineer with professional experience in the software industry since 2009, 
combining web development and engineering analysis skills with an entrepreneurial attitude. 
This is my personal blog which I intend to use both as a showcase of
[my work experience]({% post_url 2020-05-30-work-experience-overview %}) and as
a means by which I can express myself, writing for anything I consider interesting or important.

Since I believe that character and personality are at least as important as the technical skills, I think it would be more appropriate
if I start from there. The following list might not be exhaustive but is still representative and genuine nonetheless.
- I love to explore and understand the big picture before digging into the details.
- I love the details too, because they make things work and offer the satisfaction of accomplishment.
- Putting the pieces together is one of my most enjoyable experiences.
- I embrace the difficulties of becoming a specialized generalist.
- I admire the elegance of simplicity, but sometimes it annoyingly escapes me.
- Achieving and maintaining a state of high focus and alertness while working, is extremely fulfilling for me. I try to be there for a few hours every day.
- I have built through the years mental world models of decent quality, which I continuously enhance.
- I'm a restless and risk tolerant soul.
- Sometimes I'm an extrovert, most times I'm an introvert.
- I communicate better asynchronously.
- "Listen with the intent to understand, not the intent to reply". I find this motto particularly important.
- I tend to treat people with kindness and respect.
- I like to think of myself as a reliable kind person with integrity.
- I try to be at best shape every day. I don't always succeed.
- I now know the importance of good sleep, healthy diet, exercise and meaningful relations.
- I have spent a lot of time and energy on things that didn't matter. I now understand the difference between being busy and being productive.
- I also understand the importance for me, of doing meaningful work that positively impacts people's lives.
- As I evolve, the limits of my potential become more obvious to me.
I'm accepting them, becoming more realist and humble along the way, trying to embrace delegation and leverage.

My professional background spans multiple domains:
- Software engineering and full-stack development: Design and implementation of end-to-end web systems, from backend architecture and APIs to frontend interfaces and deployment pipelines.
- Digital twins and infrastructure monitoring: Development of data-driven models integrating sensor streams, physics-based simulations and optimization workflows for structural health monitoring.
- Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE): Numerical simulations, FEM-based modeling and engineering analysis for structural and mechanical systems with hands-on experience in engineering customer support.
- Entrepreneurship: Founded and operated a small web technology venture, gaining experience in product strategy, market validation, execution under resource constraints and the realities of building from zero as a solo founder.
